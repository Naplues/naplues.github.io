## Example of sentences

Such as 列举某几个(不能是全部)事物

Some of the rubbish, such as food, paper and iron, rots away over a long period of time.
有些废物，如剩饭、废纸和废铁，时间一久就烂掉了。

Animals such as rabbits and deer continue to be active all winter, finding food wherever they can.
像兔子和鹿这样的动物整个冬天都是很活跃的，它们导出寻找食物。

He knows four languages, such as Chinese and English. 他会说四种语言，例如汉语和英语。

They planted many flowers, such as roses, sunflowers, etc. 
他们种了许多种花，例如玫瑰花、向日葵等。

For example 列举同类事物中的一个, 作为插入语,用逗号隔开,可置于句首、句中和句末

For example, air is invisiable. 例如，空气是看不见的。

Xiaoming, for example, is a good student. 例如，小明就是一个好学生。

Ball games, for example, have spread around the world. 
例如，球类运动已经在世界各地传播开来了。

namely 表示全部列举
He knows three languages, namely Chinese, English and Japanese. 
他会说三种语言，如汉语、英语和日语。

include vs contain
contain 强调容量 可包含全部或者部分
include 强调范围 智能包含一部分

include 等列举次不予etc. and so on连用,语意重复

There are many cases where the code does not contain debt and there is no comment provided. 

Although more complex models and methods from NLP tasks have been introduced to alleviate this problem, in general, it is still difficult to learn the semantics of a large source file even with a model specifically designed for code representation, not to mention that exsiting methods often simply use models that are designed for natural languages.

Considering the above characteristics of bug localization, we designed a new model based on relevance matching, which combines the local matching and the global matching.

As can be seen, we observe that, we find that, 

This would be a good supplement to ..., which do not perform well. 这将是一个很好的补充

Case study research is of flexible type, as mentioned before.

A plan for a case study should at least contain the following elements:

The research questions state what is needed to know in order to fulfill the objective of the study.

Similar to the objective, the research questions evolve during the study and are narrowed to specific research questions during the study iterations.

This means that sufficient information from each step of the study and every decision taken by the researcher must be presented.

Take the change type sequence as an example.

One type of research methodology does not fit all purposes.

The importance of this work is two fold.

This is especially true for a new type of projects or projects with little historical data collected.

It is mentioning that .... . 值得一提的是

The first line of studies is ......, For example, ...... . The second line of studies is ...... . For example, ...... .

CPDP has attracted a rapid increasing interest over the past few years.

These observations reveal that much effort has been devoted to developing supervised CPDP models. However, little eﬀort has been devoted to examining whether they are superior to simple module size models.

It is important for researchers and practitioners to know the answer to this problem. If the magnitude of the difference were trivial, then simple module size models would be preferred in practice due to the low building and application cost. To answer this problem, we next compare the prediction performance of the existing supervised CPDP models with simple module size models.

To predict defects in the target release, it is common to use a two-phase process (i.e., model building and application). At the model building phase, ... .At the model application phase, ... . 

.... Our guidelines apply to all these, except assertion which is not considered a proper research method.

### Dataset

Table 2 provides an overview of the main literature concerning supervised cross-project defect prediction.

For the simplicity of presentation, 

A “Yes” entry indicates that the study explicitly considers the corresponding component and a blank entry indicates that it does not.

The 2nd column reports the use (or not) of simple module size models that classify or rank modules in the target release by their size as the baseline models.

### Result

From table 15, we have the following two observations. ...... On the one hand, On the other hand, ..... The above two observations reveal that: (1), ...... (2) .......

From Table 2, we have the following observations. First, ....... Second, ....... Third ......

Surprisingly/Interestingly, We find that......

Their results showed that

The supervised CPDP models do not show a classifcation performance superior to ManualDown(50%) in more than 85% (37/42 = 88.10%) of the performance comparisons, regardless of whether the statistical signifcance or the practical importance of the prediction performance diﬀerence is taken into account. 

Consequently, an interesting question raised is how well these newly proposed unsupervised models are when compared with the simple module size model.

For a defect prediction model, another important problem that practitioners may concern is whether they can apply the model to predict the probability of a single module being defective.
